      <label class="d-block mb-1">Who we are and what we do:</label>
      <p class="mb-1">Bureau de Connect is a Company registered in England and Wales and operates in the recruitment sector providing permanent and temporary staff in the entire United Kingdom.</p>

      <label class="d-block mb-1">OUR POLICIES</label>
      <p class="mb-1">We operate a zero-tolerance approach to modern slavery and are committed to acting ethically and with integrity in all business dealings and relationships and to implementing and enforcing effective systems and controls to ensure modern slavery is not taking place anywhere in its business or in any of its supply chains.</p>

    <h4 class="mb-1">OPT OUT OF 48 HOUR WORKING WEEK AGREEMENT</h4>
    <div class="mb-2">
      <p class="mb-1">The Working Time Regulations 1998 provide that an Employee shall not work in excess of the Working Week unless he/she agrees in writing that this limit should not apply.</p>
      <p class="mb-1"><b>Please sign and date the relevant statement(s) below and return this form to HR</b></p>
      <label class="d-block mb-1"><input type="checkbox" checked="{{policy.agreement1}}" class="mr-0_5" /> I agree to work in excess of 48 hours on average per week and will give three months' notice in writing to the Head of Human Resources if I no longer wish to work this number of hours.</label>

      <p class="mb-1">The Working Time Regulations require that an individual must agree in writing if they work for two separate employers and want to work more than 48 hours per week.</p>

      <label class="d-block mb-1">Pension Scheme - A change in the law that affects you.</label>
      <p class="mb-1">We help people save more for their retirement, all employers are now required by law to provide a workplace pension scheme for certain staff and pay money into it.</p>
      <p class="mb-1">Automatic enrolment has been designed so that eligible workers who want to build up retirement savings don't have to take any action themselves - employers will automatically enrol eligible workers into a workplace pension scheme and deduct any contributions that the member is required to pay from their wages or salary, and then pay into the pension scheme on their behalf.</p>
      <p class="mb-1">We therefore will enrol you into our pension scheme as soon as you meet all of the certain criteria:</p>
      <ul class="mb-1 ml-1">
        <li class="mb-0_5">You earn over £ 192 per week (or £ 833 per month)</li>
        <li class="mb-0_5">You are aged 18 or over and </li>
        <li class="mb-0_5">You are under state pension age</li>
        <li class="mb-0_5">You can opt out of the pension scheme if you want to, but if you stay in you will have your own personal pension when you retire. Your pension will belong to you, even if you leave us in the future.</li>
        <li class="mb-0_5">Both you and we will contribute into it every pay period, and the government will also contribute through tax relief.</li>
